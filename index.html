	<h2>Who I am?</h2>
	
	<p>Hello! My name is Geraldo Oneil Rosales Poma I am 19 years old and I live in Lima Peru, my parents are Nancy Poma Palomino and Geraldo Alexis Rosales Alarico, I studied at the Mariscal Toribio de Luzuriaga state school.</p>
	<p>During my high school I dedicated myself to completing my studies and it was not until a safe room that I got to know the world of programming, the first time I made a program was with my teacher Roberto Aponte, the program was a Linux bash script.</p>
	<h2>My aspirations</h2>
	<p>
	  One of my goals is to move forward with my family, my parents are separated, the current situation in my country and Pantemia have made these 2 years the most difficult both economically and emotionally.
	</p>
	<p>My biggest dream is to migrate to another country and to be able to practice what I like the most, which is programming.</p>
	<p>If I had not known the world of programming, now I would not know what to do with my life.</p>
